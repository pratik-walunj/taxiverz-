| Phase | Status |

| 1 — Foundation | ⛔ blocked on OWNER_TODO A1 (which spec) |
| 2–8 | not started |

## Repository move (2026-09-28)

- The project now lives in `C:\taxiverz`, a clone of `github.com/pratik-walunj/taxiverz-` (empty before this). Branch `nextjs-rebuild` is pushed to origin.
- Moved in: `CLAUDE.md` and `PROMPTS.md` at the repo root; `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`, the four Phase 0 docs, and `docs/competitor-analysis.pdf` (copied from `Downloads/Taxiverz-Competitor-Analysis.pdf`; the kit zip wasn't found).
- The older spec (`Downloads/CLAUDE.md`, 15 Sep) is archived at `docs/archive/old-spec.md`. The Downloads original was renamed `OLD-SPEC-CLAUDE.md` so it no longer loads.
- **The legacy site is not in this repo.** It lives in `github.com/pratik-walunj/Taxiverz` (`main` @ `650489a`, the exact commit the audit was run against). Phase 1 step 1 ("move the legacy site into `legacy/`") has to bring it in from there.
- The local repo in `Downloads/Taxiverz-main/Taxiverz-main/` described under Phase 0 below is left as it was. It isn't used any more.
- In the Phase 0 notes below, `docs/CLAUDE.md` now means the root `CLAUDE.md`, and `Downloads/CLAUDE.md` means `docs/archive/old-spec.md`.

## Phase 0 — Scan and audit (2026-09-28)

### Plan
1. Check the environment; create branch `nextjs-rebuild`.
2. Inventory every legacy file.
3. Extract page data (titles, meta, canonicals, H1s, JSON-LD, phones, emails, prices, distances, forms, links, images) from the repo **and** from the server snapshot, and compare them.
4. Write `docs/AUDIT.md`: confirm or correct plan §1.
5. Build and validate `docs/legacy-url-map.json`.
6. Write `docs/OWNER_TODO.md` from plan §9 plus audit findings.
7. Commit docs only. Report and stop.

### Done
- Environment: Node 24.14.1, npm 11.11.0, git 2.53. The folder **was not a git repo**. Initialised a local repo:
  - `main`: commit 1 = legacy site exactly as received (no file changed); commit 2 = the rebuild kit docs (`docs/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PROMPTS.md`, `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`) as received.
  - `nextjs-rebuild`: Phase 0 docs.
  - Local `core.autocrlf=false` so the legacy baseline is stored byte-for-byte.
  - Nothing pushed; no remote configured (OWNER_TODO A2).
- Inventory: 294 files; 156 HTML; 104 images (50.7 MB, 16 over 1 MB); 20 CSS; 3 JS; helper and junk files.
- Compared the repo with the live server snapshot (`Downloads/taxiverz.com/public_html_BACKUP_2026-08-03`, whose `index.html` matches what taxiverz.com serves today). Same 156 files; 55 differ in content. Read-only GET probes of the live site confirmed `robots.txt`, sitemap, caching headers and case-sensitive URLs.
- `docs/AUDIT.md` written. Plan §1 is largely confirmed; corrections are in AUDIT §13.
- `docs/legacy-url-map.json` **created** (it wasn't in the kit): 156/156 files mapped, validated (coverage, case collisions, URL format, no self-loops); 135 distinct targets; 56 route URLs; fallbacks for targets that may be unpublished; 2 aliases for broken internal links.
- `docs/OWNER_TODO.md` written: 45 items in 10 groups.
- Competitor report read from `Downloads/taxiverz-competitor-analysis (2).md` (text version of the PDF). `docs/competitor-analysis.pdf` isn't in the repo.

### Counts
| | |
|---|---|
| Legacy HTML pages | 156 (routes 57 files → 56 routes + 1 unverifiable; vehicles 54; services 16; shoots 16; Nepal 4; info 5; home/junk 3) |
| Pages with placeholder prices | 67 (repo) / 88 (live) |
| Pages missing a meta description | 140 |
| Pages missing a canonical / with a placeholder canonical | 152 / 4 |
| Pages reachable only via JS | 62; orphans 16; in sitemap 77 |
| Forms that send nothing | 20 |
| Near-duplicate route pairs (Jaccard > 0.35) | 52 |
| Legacy URL map | 156 entries: 142 high, 7 medium, 7 needs-owner confidence |
| Owner questions | 45 (6 of them live-site fixes) |

### Decisions made
- Treated `docs/CLAUDE.md` + `REBUILD_PLAN.md` as the working spec for the URL map. Phase 0 is stack-neutral; the conflict with `Downloads/CLAUDE.md` is escalated (OWNER_TODO A1).
- URL map schema: `target` + `fallback` + `confidence`. Redirects can go live before every target page is published, and the Phase 7 "every target returns 200" assertion still holds.
- `banaras` → `varanasi` in slugs. `siwan-chhapra` → `siwan`. The Lucknow duplicate and the two 2×2 bus pages are consolidated. The blog post maps to `/destinations/gorakhpur/places-to-visit/` (deviation from plan §7 Phase 5, flagged).
- Legacy image URLs are not mapped (see report).
- No new dependency added (none needed for Phase 0; audit scripts were stdlib Python, kept outside the repo).

### Next step
Owner answers A1 (spec) and A2 (repo). Then Phase 1 per the chosen spec.
